I dived into the classic Iris Dataset, solidifying my foundational skills in the data science pipeline. The process involved:

Data Inspection using Pandas for loading, checking shape, columns, and extracting key descriptive statistics (.info(), .describe()).

Data Visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib. I leveraged scatter plots to map feature relationships, histograms to analyze value distributions, and box plots to accurately identify potential outliers.
